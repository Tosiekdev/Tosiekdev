# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm student of the first year of Computer Science and Inteligent Systems on AGH University of Science and Technology. I'm interested in creating GUI in C++ program from scratch(SFML), or even lower(OpenGL). Also I like to create viedo games and in the future maybe even game engines. Moreover I'm passionated in Math, just love to learn calculus. I hope that some day this knowledge will help me a lot in achiving my goals.

Currently I'm member of research group that is creating computer and mobile games on my University. This is helping me in gain new skills in programming and game development, including work with complex game engine(Unity).

At this moment I can write, I have hope, good program with C++, I know basics of Python and C, and I wrote some lines of code in C#. Currently I use 3 of this languages, C++ for own projects, python for university and C# for research group.

- ðŸŒ± -I'm currently learning how to add GUI to C++ and python programs 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on video games
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with mastering C++
- âš¡ Fun fact: I haven't know for a long time that C++ has such developed standard libraries (but now I catched up)
