# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm in the third year of Computer Science and Intelligent Systems at AGH University of Science and Technology. I'm interested in creating a GUI in C++ program from scratch(SFML), or even lower(OpenGL), and sometimes higher(with the help of Dear ImGUI). Also, I like to develop video games and game engines in the future. Moreover, I'm passionate about Math and love to learn calculus. I hope that someday this knowledge will help me a lot in achieving my goals.

Currently, I'm a member of the research group that is creating computer and mobile games at my University. This is helping me gain new programming and game development skills, including working with a complex game engine(Unity).

At this moment I can write, I have hope, a good program with C++, I know the basics of Python and C, and I wrote some lines of code in C#. Currently, I use 2 of these languages, C++ for my projects and Python for university.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning how to add GUI to C++ programs
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with mastering C++
- âš¡ Fun fact: I haven't known for a long time that C++ has such developed standard libraries (but now I caught up)
