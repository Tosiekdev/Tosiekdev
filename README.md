# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the graduate of Computer Science and Intelligent Systems at AGH University of Science and Technology and I'm continuing my education here at Master studies in the same subject. I'm interested in Neural Netoworks, Agent-based systems and C++ (especially templates). I'm also passionate about Math and I'd love to learn how it is used in machine learning algorithms.

At this moment I have some experiance in using C++ and Python. Additionally during my academic journey I have used languages like: Rust, Java, TypeScript, C and C#.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning how to write LLMs
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m developing my own framework for Agent-Based Modelling (it was my Bachelor Thesis)
- âš¡ I have created library for parisng [mathematical functions](https://github.com/Tosiekdev/function-parser)
